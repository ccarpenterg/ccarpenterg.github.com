The three of us have managed the epic voyage from New Zealand, through Kuala Lumpur, and Belfast, and are now back in Ireland! It's great to be back.

Now that the jet lag has passed, I'm on the lookout for some work. With that in mind, I've put <a href="/cv/">my cv online</a>, and it's also available to download in Word format <a href="/cv.doc">here</a>.

In the meantime, have a great Paddy's day week, and here's hoping this lovely weather stays so mild.
