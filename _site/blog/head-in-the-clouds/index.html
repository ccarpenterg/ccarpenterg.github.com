	<section class="entry"><p>A little while back, my hosting company <a href='http://slicehost.com'>Slicehost</a> was purchased by <a href='http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/'>Rackspace</a>. While this didn&#8217;t change much at first, they are now in the process of migrating accounts to Rackspace&#8217;s cloud platform.</p>

<p>As someone who&#8217;s hosting bill has been a steady and predictable bill for the past 6 years, moving to the cloud is a bit of a change. I tidied up the server last weekend and pushed through the migration to the cloud system, and now I have no idea how much it&#8217;s going to cost by the end of the month.</p>

<h2 id='nebulous_billing'>Nebulous billing</h2>

<p>Cloud hosting has an interesting approach to billing. Rather than pay a fixed amount for a server with a certain amount of RAM and a maximum bandwidth allowance, you are charged for what you use. As someone who could use between 15GB and 100GB in a month but never gave it much thought, I imagine this billing style could result in surprising bills.</p>

<h2 id='price_comparison'>Price comparison</h2>

<p>Having been on the service for just a few days, it&#8217;s looking like the cloud system will be a little cheaper. I did some quick calculations and found that rather than pay $20 / $38 per month for the basic 256MB / 512MB slices on Slicehost, it&#8217;ll be somewhere between $13.65 and $28.95, depending on bandwidth.</p>

<h2 id='investigating_other_options'>Investigating other options</h2>

<p>Since I&#8217;ve gone to cloud with the existing server, I thought I&#8217;d look into some of the options. Aside from the ongoing cost, finding a service with a locations in Ireland was something that mattered to me. With this in mind, I set up an account with Amazon&#8217;s AWS services to use their <a href='http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/'>Elastic Compute Cloud</a> (EC2).</p>

<p>Activating virtual servers (instances) within Amazon is straightforward, but I&#8217;ll get into some of the specifics of setting up a multi-domain server in another post. The interface is pretty good, with plenty of resources around to help understand the terminology.</p>

<h2 id='ec2_pricing'>EC2 Pricing</h2>

<p>This is where I&#8217;m less clear. The account I signed up for includes the use of a &#8220;Micro&#8221; instance, which is free for one year. After the year, it will be $15 per month. Bandwidth is a little cheaper than Rackspace. Rather than $0.18 per GB, Amazon charges $0.12 per GB. This would mean a total bill of between $16.80 and $27, assuming the &#8220;Micro&#8221; instance was enough to be going with.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, it turns out that if the Micro instance isn&#8217;t enough and I need to upgrade to a &#8220;Small&#8221; instance, the instance cost increases to $60 per month (1.7GB server). An equivalent instance from Rackspace would be between $43.80 (1GB) and $87.60 (2GB). However, Rackspace offer smaller server size increases, with the next size up (512MB) costing $16 per month.</p>

<h2 id='making_the_call'>Making the call</h2>

<p>Thankfully Amazon allow the Micro instance to be run for a year before charging, so I plan to give it a reasonable go before making the call as to whether I&#8217;m going to need more than what the Micro can offer.</p>
